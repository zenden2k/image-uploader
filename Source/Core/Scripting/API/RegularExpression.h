        Creating instance: local regex = CRegExp(pattern, flags);

        pattern - regular expression,

        flags:

        <b>i</b> - PCRE_CASELESS

        If this modifier is set, letters in the pattern match both upper and lower case letters.

        <b>m</b> - PCRE_MULTILINE

        By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a single "line" of characters
            (even if it actually contains several newlines). The "start of line" metacharacter (^)
            matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter ($)
            matches only at the end of the string, or before a terminating newline (unless D
            modifier is set). This is the same as Perl. When this modifier is set, the "start
            of line" and "end of line" constructs match immediately following or immediately
            before any newline in the subject string, respectively, as well as at the very start
            and end. This is equivalent to Perl's /m modifier. If there are no "\n" characters in
            a subject string, or no occurrences of ^ or $ in a pattern, setting this modifier has
            no effect.

        <b>s</b> - PCRE_DOTALL

        If this modifier is set, a dot metacharacter in the pattern matches all characters, including
            newlines. Without it, newlines are excluded. This modifier is equivalent to Perl's /s
            modifier. A negative class such as [^a] always matches a newline character, independent
            of the setting of this modifier.

        <b>x</b> - PCRE_EXTENDED

        If this modifier is set, whitespace data characters in the pattern are totally ignored except
            when escaped or inside a character class, and characters between an unescaped # outside
            a character class and the next newline character, inclusive, are also ignored. This is
            equivalent to Perl's /x modifier, and makes it possible to include commentary inside
            complicated patterns. Note, however, that this applies only to data characters.
            Whitespace characters may never appear within special character sequences in a pattern,
            for example within the sequence (?( which introduces a conditional subpattern.

        <b>u</b> - PCRE_UTF8|PCRE_UCP

        This modifier turns on additional functionality of PCRE that is incompatible with Perl.
            Pattern and subject strings are treated as UTF-8. Five and six octet UTF-8 sequences are
            regarded as invalid.
