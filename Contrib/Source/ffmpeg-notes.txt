To set up a proper environment in MSYS2, you need to run msys_shell.bat from the Visual Studio or Intel Compiler command prompt.

Place yasm.exe somewhere in your PATH. If using MSVC 2012 or earlier, place c99wrap.exe and c99conv.exe somewhere in your PATH as well.

Next, make sure any other headers and libs you want to use, such as zlib, are located in a spot that the compiler can see. Do so by modifying the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables to include the Windows-style paths to these directories. Alternatively, you can try and use the --extra-cflags/--extra-ldflags configure options. If using MSVC 2012 or earlier, place inttypes.h somewhere the compiler can see too.

pacman -s yasm diffutils

Finally, run:

For MSVC:
./configure --enable-asm --enable-yasm --arch=i386 --disable-ffserver --disable-avdevice  --disable-doc --disable-ffmpeg --disable-ffplay --disable-ffprobe --disable-ffmpeg --enable-shared --disable-static --disable-bzlib --disable-libopenjpeg --disable-iconv --prefix=/c/ffmpeg --disable-encoders --disable-muxers  --disable-filters --disable-devices  --disable-swresample    --disable-avfilter   --disable-network    --disable-network  --toolchain=msvc

For ICL:
./configure --toolchain=icl

make
make install

Note:
configure script is modified for VS 2008 support.
Configure may fail to detect headers, so you must edit config.h and set

#define HAVE_DIRECT_H 1
#define HAVE_IO_H 1
