Building on Windows:

You need Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 to build Image Uploader. 
Installing Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 is strongly recommended (older versions corrupt .rc files after editing)
If you are using a newer MSVC version, you may experience some compilation errors, which can be solved easily (if you fix these errors, please provide a patch or pull request). 
But also you need to recompile 3rd-party 
libraries (boost, glog, jsoncpp, etc) against your compiler version (so I recommend to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 4 to avoid all these issues).

You can download ALL necessary libraries and headers (precompiled for MSVC 2013) by following link:

Image Uploader is using the following libraries:

libcurl         http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ (patched version)

openssl         https://www.openssl.org

zlib            http://www.zlib.net

Boost           http://www.boost.org (patched version)

pcre            http://www.pcre.org

pcre++          http://www.daemon.de/PCRE (patched version)

squirrel        http://squirrel-lang.org (patched version)

sqrat		    http://scrat.sourceforge.net (patched version)

libwebp         https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp

base64          https://github.com/aklomp/base64

Libraries for Mega.nz support:

Mega SDK        https://github.com/meganz/sdk

Crypto++        https://www.cryptopp.com/

c-ares          https://c-ares.haxx.se/

libuv           https://github.com/libuv/libuv


If you want to compile strmbase.lib by yourself you will need:

DirectX 8 SDK

DirectShow BaseClasses

Building on Ubuntu:

Before compiling IU install the following packages:

sudo apt-get install g++ cmake cmake-qt-gui autoconf automake libtool fakeroot libgtest-dev libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-locale-dev libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev libpcre3-dev libc-ares-dev liburiparser-dev libicu-dev libsqlite3-dev libreadline-dev libfreeimage-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
#libuv1-dev
#libcrypto++-dev
#libgumbo-dev
#libgoogle-glog-dev
mega:

Need to build gtest:
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake .
sudo make
sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/

debian package dependencies:
libpcre3
#libgumbo1
#libcrypto++9v5
libcurl3
libssl1.0.0
#libgoogle-glog0

-- For mega:
libc-ares2
libuv1
libsqlite3-0
libfreeimage3

glog,gflags,libuv,cryptopp,gumbo have to be statically built from source. Before building glog remove package libgflags-dev
Also libjsoncpp need to build (from Contrib folder)
