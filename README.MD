##Building from source

You need Microsoft Visual C++ at least 9.0 version (Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1). 
If you are using a newer MSVC version, you may experience some compilation errors, which can be solved easily (if you fix these errors, please provide a patch or pull request). 
But also you need to recompile 3rd-party 
libraries (squirrel, glog, zthread, jsoncpp) against your compiler version (so I recommend to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1 to avoid all these issues).


If you are using Visual Studio prior to 2010 version, you have to install Microsoft Windows 7 Platform SDK (or later) for enabling Windows 7 related features.
Also yoo need to install "msinttypes" headers. 

In order to compile Image Uploader you will need the following libraries:

WTL             http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/

libcurl         http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/

openssl         https://www.openssl.org

zlib            http://www.zlib.net

pcre            http://www.pcre.org

pcre++          http://www.daemon.de/PCRE

squirrel        http://squirrel-lang.org

sqplus          http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqplus/

ffmpeg          https://www.ffmpeg.org

tinyxml         http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml/

zthreads        http://zthread.sourceforge.net

minizip         http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html

jsoncpp         https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

glog            https://github.com/google/glog

boost           http://www.boost.org

You can download ALL necessary libraries and headers (precompiled for MSVC 2008 SP1) by following link:

https://bintray.com/artifact/download/zenden/zenden-image-uploader/Image_Uploader_Contrib_MSVC_2008_SP1_and_sources_v1.3.1_06.04.2015.7z

(precompiled for MSVC 2013)

If you want to compile strmbase.lib by yourself you will need:

DirectX 8 SDK

DirectShow BaseClasses

If you receive errors related to "TOKEN_ELEVATION" or "ITaskBar3", it means you haven't installed latest Platform SDK. 

Also you can change WINVER value into "stdafx.h" file to 0x0600 or 0x0501 and compile Image Uploader 
without Windows 7 TaskBar features support.
