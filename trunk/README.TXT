---  COMPILING IMAGE UPLOADER ----

You need Microsoft Visual C++ at least 8.0 version (I compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET  2005 & 2008, not tested on 2003 or Express Edition).

In order to compile Image Uploader you will need the following libraries:
 1. WTL: http://wtl.sourceforge.net
 2. DirectShow BaseClasses
 3. DirectX 8 SDK

You can download necessary Include files and Libs here http://code.google.com/p/image-uploader/downloads/list
